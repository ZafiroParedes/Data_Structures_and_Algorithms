# Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are locted in the sorting folder. Algorithms avilable are:
- Heap
- Merge
- Quick
- Shaker

The README file for compiling and running the sorting algorithms can be found [here](sorting/README.md).

# Data Structures
Data structures implemented are avilable in the repository. Data structures avilable are:
- Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Hashtable

## Executing
The data structures utilize files with lines of information for people. People objects are created with the format of the files and what the information represents. The database file used has the following format for each line 

> firstname

## Results

### Binary Tree

### Hastable
